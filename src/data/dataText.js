    Hi! I'm Thiago, an IT student at CCT College Dublin.
    Over the past three years, I've been challenging myself in the field of Information Technology. 
    From learning programming fundamentals to exploring database management, networking, and other things, I have tried to gain a strong base in IT.
    I've also sought practical experience through online courses.
    Now, as I approach the end of my studies, I am excited to apply my knowledge and skills and make a positive impact in the IT industry.
